 ## Installation
 
  just clone and run index.html 😋
 
 ## Drawbacks
 
 There is some drawbacks with this project 🙁 and some of them are:
 
 - As we storing files in localstorage and them load them as base64 url to music element.So,loading big music files(>50MB) cause website slow down.
 - On video files screen off cause music pause and which is also not triggered by media-Session-Api.
 
 ## Improvements

 - User Interface can be improved
